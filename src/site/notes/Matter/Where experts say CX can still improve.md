## Highlights
* you get the impression that brands don’t remember anything about us as customers —
  * **Note**: questo è un vantaggio della cdp,  o comunque di far parlare diversi silo nello stesso linguaggio
* To keep a good record of this overall relationship with customers, a lot of companies are going to have to update outdated tech stacks, and figure out how to integrate siloed data.
  * **Note**: e questo è un motivo perché per mettere il cliente al centro c'è un problema di dati
* That deficit of information means they can’t connect the dots between their platform and the tangible changes they are driving in their customer’s business.
* companies must consider how bots fit into customer journeys and how they support an end-to-end orchestrated customer experience, as opposed to just one-time individual interactions.
  * **Note**: sempre in ottica di CDP, aggiungere un nuovo strumento o un nuovo canale va messo in armonia con tutti gli altri
* When we think about orchestrating an experience, brands pull relevant information from different systems to carry context.
