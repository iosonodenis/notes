## Highlights
* If you want to learn and remember something long-term, you have to write it down. If you want to understand an idea, you have to translate it into your own words.
* The purpose of research is to produce public knowledge that can be scrutinized and tested. For that to happen, it has to be written down. And once it is, what the author meant doesn’t matter – only the actual words written on the page matter.
  * **Note**: Praticamente, se non hai il coraggio di condividerlo con altri non hai il coraggio di condividerlo con te stesso
* Work as if writing is the only thing that matters.

* In other words, instead of filing things away according to where they came from, you file them according to where they’re going. This is the essential difference between organizing like a librarian and organizing like a writer.
* Plans are meant to help us feel in control. But it is much more important to actually be in control, which means being able to steer our work towards what we consider interesting and relevant.
* When we focus on open connections, disconfirming or contradictory data suddenly becomes very valuable. It often raises new questions and opens new paths of inquiry. The experience of having one piece of data completely change your perspective can be exhilarating.
* We need to find ways to counteract confirmation bias –
