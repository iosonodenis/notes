title: 'Digital Garden'

The best definition that came into my mind about a digital garden is _like geocities, but without the geocities domain_. Sometimes even like Tumblr, but without the chronological order.

A mind garden is not a mind backyard. Itâ€™s not about dumping notes in there and forgetting about them.
